* #### Keywords
// Keywords are reserved words in Java that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used for naming variables,
// methods, classes, or other identifiers.
// Identifiers, on the other hand, are names that you create to identify variables, methods, classes, and other entities in your code.
// Identifiers must follow certain rules,such as starting with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($), and cannot be the same as keywords.
// In the provided code, `package`, `public`, `class`, and `static` are keywords, while
// `Lab007_Keywords_Identifier` and `main` are identifiers.
// * - **Simple English words** which are having predefined meaning in **Java Programming Language.**
// * - Keywords are also called **Reserved Words.**
// * - All the keywords are defined in **Lower Case.  **
// * - We **canâ€™t use keywords** as names for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifiers.
